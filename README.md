This is a personal project for learning how to use GraphQL federation. 

First phase: write two subgraphs in Typescript with hardcoded data, test calling them in GraphQL playground (done) 
Second phase: write them in python, for practice (in progress) 
Third phase: replace hardcoded data with SQL table (to do) 
Fourth phase: replace hardcoded data with NoSQL table (to do)
